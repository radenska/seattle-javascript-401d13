=====================================

## AWS S3
  * **Overview**
    * S3 *(Amazon Simple Storage Service)* is a scalable object storage platform
    * S3 will be used as a way to store images used within our application
    * using the `aws-sdk` module, each time a new file is saved we will be provided with a url to the associated file
      * this url is what we will be saving to the database in our application, not the actual file
    * when uploading files to S3, we consider each file to be an "object"
    * "objects" can then be contained in buckets for later use
  
## Helpers
  * **`.env` config**
  ``` javascript
    PORT='8000'
    MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost/yourdbname'
    APP_SECRET='yourdbsecret'
    AWS_BUCKET='yourbucketname'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='youraccesskey'
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='yoursecretkey'
  ```
  
  * **newly added `npm` modules**
    * `multer` - used for handling multipart form data (`entype="multipart/form-data"`)
    * `del` - deletes files and folders
    * `aws-sdk` - official sdk (software development kit) with helper tools for working with AWS

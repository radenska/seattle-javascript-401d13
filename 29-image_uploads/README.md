=====================================

## Image Uploads
  * **Overview**
    * unlike most of our previous requests, file uploads require a `Content-Type` of `multipart/form-data`
    * this gives us the ability to upload images and other file types
    * angular does not support `input` tags with a `type="file"`, therefor we will be using a 3rd party module to allow our app to have this functionality
    * `ng-file-upload` is a 3rd party module that comes with special helper directives and services to upload files
    * `ng-file-upload` supports single file uploads, multiple file uploads, drag and drop capabilities, and basic file type validation

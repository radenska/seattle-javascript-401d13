=====================================

## Deployment, Heroku, TravisCI & Configuring Staging/Production Pipelines
  * **TravisCI**
    * create and configure a `.travis.yml` file that will be used to tell TravisCI to run your npm `test` and `lint` scripts
    * example `.travis.yml`

    ``` javascript
      language: node_js
      node_js:
        - 'stable'
      services:
        - mongodb
      addons:
        apt:
          sources:
            - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
          packages:
            - gcc-4.8
            - g++-4.8
      env:
        - CXX=g++-4.8
      sudo: required
      before_script: npm i
      script:
        - npm test
        - npm run lint
    ```

  * **Heroku Deployment**
    - enable your repository to work with TravisCI
      - *note: you may have to sync your account for TravisCI to show the repo as an option*
    - add your environment variables to TravisCI by clicking on the **Settings** option in the **More options** dropdown
    - log into the Heroku dashboard
    - create a new app
    - create a staging app *(ex: cfgram-staging)*
    - click on the **Resources** tab
    - in the **Add-ons** section, type *mongo* and choose the mLab option and associated free price plan
      - *note: you will need to provide a credit card with Heroku to do this - even with the free option*
    - click on the **Settings** tab
    - click on the **Reveal Config Vars** button and add your environment variables
      - *note: you do not need to add the MONGODB_URI variable as this was added by Heroku when you provisioned the DB - there's also no need to add a PORT, Heroku will handle this for you*
    - click on the **Deploy** tab
    - create a new pipeline called **staging**
    - click the button to connect your application to GitHub
    - in the **Automatic deploys** field, click the checkbox to **Wait for CI to pass before deploy**, choose **staging** as your deployment branch *(you'll need to already have a `staging` branch pushed to GitHub)* and click the button to **Enable Automatic Deploys**
    - **repeat** the following steps to create a production pipeline
      - *note: be sure to name the application "myapp-production", add it to a production pipeline, and enable automatic deploys to deploy to your `master` branch*

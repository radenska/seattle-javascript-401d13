=====================================

## What is a Tree?
  * **Overview**
    * trees are a widely used data structure that simulate a hierarchical "tree" structure
    * tree data structures contain a **root**, which may or may not contain a series of child sub-trees
    * tree data structures are often  defined recursively as a collection of nodes, which starts at the root node
      * each node is a data structure consisting of a value and an array of references to any child nodes
    * trees are considered to be a directed, acyclic, connected graph

  * **Breaking Down A Tree**
    * **root:** - the top node in a tree
    * **child:** - a node that's a direct sub-tree of another node
    * **siblings:** - a group of nodes with the same parent
    * **leaf:** - a node with node children

  * **Useful Implementations of Trees**
    * the DOM
    * a computer file system
    * sorting and searching

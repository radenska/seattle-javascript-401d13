## Singly Linked List
  * **Overview**
    * a singly linked list is a data structure that is used to hold a sequence of interconnected (aka linked) nodes
    * each node in the list contains some sort of data along with a pointer, which is used to point to another node in the list

## Doubly Linked List
  * **Overview**
    * a doubly linked list utilizes the same functionality as a singly linked list and adds the ability for bi-directional movement within the list
    * this provides us with the ability to move from the first node in the list to the last node in the list and vice versa
